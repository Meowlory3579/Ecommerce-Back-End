## Installation for developers
Install Node.js, if needed.     

Create a .gitignore file and include "node_modules", ".env", ".vscode", "package-lock.json", and ".DS_Store" in it, so that these files aren't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.     

Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running "npm init" when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
